## ✨ Key Features

* **💻 100% Local Execution:** Run directly on your PC or server without complex deployment, fully utilizing and controlling your computing resources.
* **🤖 Multiple AI Model Support:** Flexibly switch between providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, and Ollama.
* **🛠️ Powerful MCP Integration:** Seamlessly connect external tools (browser automation, database operations, etc.) into chat via Model Context Protocol.
* **🚀 Standalone Tool Tester:** Test and debug MCP tools separately from the main chat interface.
* **💬 Intuitive Mentions:** Trigger available tools with `@` in the input field.
* **⚙️ Easy Server Setup:** Configure MCP connections via UI or `.mcp-config.json` file.
* **📄 Markdown UI:** Communicate in a clean, readable markdown-based interface.
* **💾 Zero-Setup Local DB:** Uses SQLite by default for local storage (PostgreSQL also supported).
* **🧩 Custom MCP Server Support:** Modify the built-in MCP server logic or create your own.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the recommended package manager.

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pnpm i

# 2. Initialize project (creates .env, sets up DB)
pnpm initial

# 3. Start dev server
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to get started.

-----

### Environment Variables

The `pnpm initial` command generates a `.env` file. Add your API keys there:

```dotenv
GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY=****
OPENAI_API_KEY=****
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=****
```

SQLite is the default DB (`db.sqlite`). To use PostgreSQL, set `USE_FILE_SYSTEM_DB=false` and define `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`.

-----

### MCP Server Setup

You can connect MCP tools via:

1. **UI Setup:** Go to http://localhost:3000/mcp and configure through the interface.
2. **Direct File Edit:** Modify `.mcp-config.json` in project root.
3. **Custom Logic:** Edit `./custom-mcp-server/index.ts` to implement your own logic.

-----

## 💡 Use Cases

* [Supabase Integration](./docs/use-cases/supabase.md): Use MCP to manage Supabase DB, auth, and real-time features.

-----

## 🗺️ Roadmap: Upcoming Features

We're making MCP Client Chatbot even more powerful with these planned features:

* **🎨 Canvas Mode:** Real-time editing interface for LLM + user collaboration (e.g. code, blogs).
* **🧩 LLM UI Generation:** Let LLMs render charts, tables, forms dynamically.
* **📜 Rule Engine:** Persistent system prompt/rules across the session.
* **🖼️ Image & File Uploads:** Multimodal interaction via uploads and image generation.
* **🐙 GitHub Mounting:** Mount local GitHub repos to ask questions and work on code.
* **📚 RAG Agent:** Retrieval-Augmented Generation using your own documents.
* **🧠 Planning Agent:** Smarter agent that plans and executes complex tasks.
* **🧑‍💻 Agent Builder:** Tool to create custom AI agents for specific goals.
